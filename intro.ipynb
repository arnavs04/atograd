    "The `mingrad` package is a minimal implementation of automatic differentiation and computational graphs in Python, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's `micrograd` library. It serves as an educational resource to understand the fundamental concepts behind modern deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Karpathy's `micrograd` is a minimalist autograd engine written in Python, designed to illustrate the core principles of backpropagation and automatic differentiation. The `mingrad` package follows a similar philosophy, providing a lightweight and easy-to-understand codebase that demystifies the inner workings of these essential concepts."

    "Automatic differentiation (AD) is a computational technique used to evaluate the derivatives of functions efficiently and accurately. Unlike symbolic differentiation, which can become cumbersome and complex, or numerical differentiation, which can be imprecise, AD leverages the chain rule of calculus to systematically apply differentiation operations to the basic arithmetic operations and elementary functions in a program. This process yields exact derivatives, is highly efficient, and works for functions of arbitrary complexity, making it a powerful tool in various fields such as machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation (AD) comes in two primary modes: forward mode and reverse mode, both based on the chain rule. \n",
    "1. In forward mode, the computation propagates from the input variables to the output variables, computing the derivative of each intermediate variable with respect to the input variables. This mode is efficient for functions with a small number of inputs and a larger number of outputs. For a function $f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$, forward mode calculates the derivative of each $x_i$ through each step of the function until the final output. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. On the other hand, reverse mode propagates from the output variables back to the input variables, computing the derivative of the output variable with respect to each intermediate variable. This mode is efficient for functions with a large number of inputs and a single output. For a function $f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$, reverse mode calculates the derivatives by first evaluating the function normally and then propagating gradients from the output back through each intermediate step to the inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Forward mode is typically used when the number of inputs is small, while reverse mode is more suited for functions with a single output and many inputs, such as in training neural networks."

Each node represents a specific operation, and the edges between nodes represent the flow of data. This graph-like structure allows for efficient computation and, more importantly, enables automatic differentiation."
